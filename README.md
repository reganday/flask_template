This form was created using python flask, html, and css by Regan Day and Molly Siebenaler for BAIS:3300.  It predicts salaries using AI based on age range, gender, country, highest degree, coding experience, current title, and company size.

The templates folder contains the three html pages that populate the form and an about page.  App.py defines the python functions running in the backend of the form.
